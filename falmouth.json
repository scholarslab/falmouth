          "Two story building, nogged with brick and covered with board siding. Double hipped roof. The south facade has a central door with a shed roof that leads to a central hallway. Windows on the first floor are glass jalousie three. The 2nd floor windows are 6x6 with green louvers flanking either side. A raised porch is located on the East of the South facade. Access to the porch is a cut stone, arched stairway. A door and a 6x6 window opens onto the porch. The north facade (1st floor) has Flemish bond brickwork. A double door is located at the NW corner. Wood louvers are found on the 1st and 2nd floor (north). The rear section (east) is about three feet shorter than the rest of the building. Likely, it is an addition w/ a double hip. The whole building is painted cream with evidence of sand-dashing. Much replacement siding and windows evident. 2nd story addition to the west. Either it enclosed an existing porch or it is an altogether new addition. There is no beading on the boards on the west and south facades of the addition. The north facade appears to have a historic brick, flemish bond pattern for the first floor and parged second floor. The addition serves as the main entrance with wood louvered windows. Addition on the southeast corner. May be the enclosure of the southern corner of an existing raised porch. A glass jalousie is located on the south and a door opening to the porch from the east. Under the porch are two 6-paned casements and a single door. ",
